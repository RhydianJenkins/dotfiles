# NEOVIM CONFIG

1. Copy these files into `~/.config/nvim`.
2. Open neovim and run `:PlugInstall`.
3. You need to install language servers individually for LSP support. Seek [help in the lsp repo](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig).

# Wishlist

- Github Copilot (without ghost text NeoVim issue)
- Convert lua
- More information on intellesense (lots of 'unknown' currently)
- Better Vim compatibility
- Optional config to allow up and running with less effort, e.g. no tabnine if not logged in
- Better window/buffer managment
- Highlight occurrences on hover
