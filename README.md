Some config for my own personal use. See directories for individual configs.

## Nerd Fonts

For icons, [NerdFonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts) are needed to be installed.

After downloading some `.tff` files, place them in the `$HOME/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts` directory and set your terminal font to that nerd font.
