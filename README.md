# .dotfiles
Some dotfiles for my own personal use.

# Installation
Clone the repo, then run the install script:

> :warning: **This will replace your current dot files in your $HOME**. Be very careful here!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RhydianJenkins/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

After a shell restart, functions, aliases, and other personal customisations should be applied.

# NeoVim

See the [nvim readme](nvim/README.md) for installation instructions on my NeoVim setup.

# Nerd Fonts

For icons to work, [NerdFonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts) are needed to be installed.

After downloading some `.tff` files, place them in the `$HOME/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts` directory and set your terminal font to that nerd font.
