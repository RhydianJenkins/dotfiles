These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

## Nerd Fonts

If not using nix, you'll need to download a [NerdFont](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts) for icons.

After downloading some `.tff` files, place them in the `$HOME/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts` directory and set your terminal font to that nerd font.
